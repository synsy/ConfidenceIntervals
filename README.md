# Diameter Stats Viz

A Python-based statistical analysis of sample diameter measurements.  
This project calculates confidence intervals (90% and 99%) for the sample mean, computes key statistics, and visualizes the results with histograms and error bar plots.

## ðŸ“ˆ Features

- Calculates sample mean and standard deviation
- Computes 90% and 99% confidence intervals using the t-distribution
- Visualizes data distribution with:
  - Histogram overlaid with confidence intervals
  - Error bar plot for visualizing confidence intervals
- Built with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib

## ðŸ§ª Sample Data

The dataset consists of 50 diameter measurements (in arbitrary units), stored directly in the script as a list.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
